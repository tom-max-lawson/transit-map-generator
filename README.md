This repo contains the prototype for TransitScaper - a game about re-imagining transit for real cities around the world.

## Metro map generation
The underlying algorithm is implemented by using the clone of https://github.com/budul100/transit-map, which basically implements something along the lines of the paper by Wolff and Nollenburg.
